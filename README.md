###Using Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection Data to predict events using different classifiers

[Kaggle Grasp-and-Lift Detection Data ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection/data)

In this project we aim to classify six different events from pre-processed EEG data using different classifiers. The six events are as follows: HandStart, FirstDigitTouch, BothStartLoadPhase, LiftOff, Replace, and BothReleased. The classifiers we will be using are logistic regression, linear SVM, gradient boosting, and LDA.
